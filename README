Running Instructions:
    1. Compile the server
        - Run the makefile provided in the server folder by executing "make" in the terminal
    2. Run the client and server
        - Run the makefile provided in the base directory by executing "make" in the terminal
        - If an error occurs, or the server fails to open, execute "make clean" in the terminal, then repeat from step 1.
    3. Select two points on the map window, and shortest path between the two points will be displayed
        - Client and server will continue to run, allowing user to select more points if desired.
    4. When finished close the map window, and the server and client should both quit.
